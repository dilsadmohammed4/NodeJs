    Modules In Node Js:-

    - Modules in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organised in single or multiple javascript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js
    - Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript Libraries.
    - A set of you want to include in your application.
    - Helps in sharing, re-using the shared pieces of functionality.
    - Easy to maintain, extends and debug.

/*
    1. Modules any simple or complex piece of functionality which is separated out in another file.
    2. Modules helps us in Modular design of Application.

    App
        - Users     //Users.js
        - Invoices  //invoices.js
            - create Invoices
            - update invoices
        - Orders    //order.js
            - create order
            - update order
            - delete order
        - Products

    3. Modules helps in Reusing the code

    4. Easy to maintain and extends and debug.

    5. Nodejs - a lot of built-in, ready to use Modules
        - Common functionality
        - Everyone
        e.g
            http    //anyone whonis working with HTTP
            fs  //again anyone working in fs

    6. What is the complete list of bulit-in modules?
        - Do not worry -Chapter 14 -core modules

    Creating Custom Modules

    - We can create Custom Modules in Node Js
    - It is best practice to always create functionality in Modules.
    - It helps in making the code easier to maintain, extends and also helps in modular approach architecture.
        - Modules and Exports -Global Object
        - These are 2 most frequently used Global Object in Node Js.


    App
        - Common
        - Modules
            - Users
            - Billing
            - Products
            - Invoices
            - Orders
            - Reviews
            - Images

    - Example #1 - using modules.exports with a Function.       --//invoices.js

    - Example #2 - using modules.exports with a Variable.       --//users.js
        - Clashes with same variable names.
            - It leads to lot of problems.
        - This is best practice to define global variable which are re used.

    - Example #2 - using modules.exports with a Class.             --//order.js

/*
    Shared Modules

    - Modules which are exported and used in other modules will share the same variable instance and it's value.
    - It's way of sharing code and values between various modules.


    -- Modules which are used inside other modules.
    -- The values are updated for the variable since they share same memory instance.
    -- Whenever we update a value in shaed module -its updated in the main modules.

    - What Use Cases?
        - Real time  Chat Application.
            - You want to people to see same "Info".
        - Notification
            - Some value got updated.
                - You need to specify and show the updated value.
        - Order Tracking
            - Status Change
                - The same change appearing everywhere else

    Precautions of using Shared Modules:
        - Since the value is always updated.
            - Be extremly careful when doing these modules.
            - This lead to dengerous results in
