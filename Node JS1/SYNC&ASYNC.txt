We will learn all about

    1. Sync
    2. Async
    3. Promise
    4. Try and Catch

1. Sync / Synchronous
    - Step by Step Execution.
    - Sequential Execution - Top to Down.
    - Wait for Request.
    - This is Slow - By Design.
    - It is not waste like most people think
        - The same thing they think about most Backbenchers?

2. Async / Asynchronous
    - DO NOT wait and proceed with Execution of code.
    - When you received the response - Process it.



Sync and Async:
---------------

1. Async methods will be called independently and executed parellarly.
    - They do not wait for requests to be completed.
    - As and when we get response - It will be processed.

2. Node Js is by default Async processing.
3. Thats why Node Js is fast in processing.

4. Sync - Which means we need the first method to be completed and then the next method
    - Executed Sequentially.
    - Step by Step.
    - From Top to Bottom.

5. Sync method using Trt/Catch Block.

6. Sync - Through Promises
    new Promise(resolve, reject)
        - Based on reslove or reject.
            - You can bind the second method in calling.
